# CS-360---Final
This Inventory Management app is designed to help you keep track of your belongings, whether you are a personal user who wants to keep track of things collected over the years, or a photographer who wants to keep track of his or her gear, or a small business owner tracking his or her lawn mowing equipment. The app was designed with safety in mind. It not only keeps your inventory from the prying eye by locking it behind a login screen, it also requires a complex password when setting up an account, which significantly reduces the changes of an unauthorized user to guess it and get access to your data.
